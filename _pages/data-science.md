## Student Applicant Accept/Reject Classifier
This project uses 3 years of data collected during my time as a graduate assistant. One of the larger goals during the school
year was building the incoming class. I wanted to create a model that would help eliminate a time consuming step (interviewing) in the student application process.

## Analysis of Pharmaceutical Export Data
I performed an analysis on some supply chain data to see what the largest line items were and where they were going. The script
also allowed me to experiment with [missingno](https://github.com/ResidentMario/missingno), a nifty module that visualizes
missing data.
