# Summary

I'm a recent graduate and aspiring data scientist looking to apply my domain knowledge to help others solve challenging problems. I received my B.S. in General Biology from Penn State as well as my M.S. in Bioengineering (synthetic biology) and MBA from Wilkes University.

## Why Data Science?

I've grown very fond of the power behind making data driven decisions. The flexibility that adding machine learning capabilities to this decision making process means the possibilities are far reaching. Further, having come from a life sciences background where research is driven by the scientific method, the transition to thinking like an analyst was familiar.

## Academic History

My undergrad degree was more breadth than depth, which gave me a good overview of everything in the world of biology from ecology to microbiology (with all the chem/physics/bio labs in between). After finishing undergrad I decided to further my education and fortunately found that opportunity in my hometown. The synthetic biology track at Wilkes focused on engineering synthetic biological systems to solve medical and environmental problems. We had some hands on experience with recombinant technology and we able to explore topics of our choosing, of which, I chose to focus on [CRISPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR)...think Microsoft Word, but the words on the screen are your DNA and the cursor and delete button work in tandem as scissors. About halfway through my first master's I took some business courses and decided I would also start working on my MBA. The program was structured like many others with courses including, but not limited to, managerial accounting, finance, economics, leadership, strategy, etc. Out of all of it, nothing was more impactful to me than learning to think strategically. During the last year of my 3-year, post-grad venture, I took a deep dive into the ins and outs of data science and its wide-encompassing, relatable applications, and haven't looked back.
